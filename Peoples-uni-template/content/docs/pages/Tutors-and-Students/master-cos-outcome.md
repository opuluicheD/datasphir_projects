# The Master Module Course Characteristics and Outcome

## Students enrolled on the master’s course site, 2008-2020

We report on the 562 students who passed at least one module, up to and including those enrolled in first semester 2020, whose results were available by the time that Peoples-uni closed. A number of other students enrolled, but did not take, or pass, a module assignment.

Of these 562 students, 220 (41%) were female, and the average age was 38years. 193 (36%) had a medical degree, 172 (32%) a non-medical degree in health and 116 (21%) a non-health related degree. 11 students had a previous PhD and 126 (23%) reported a previous master’s degree.

211 students (39%) reported that they were working in public health, 138 (26%)were clinicians, while 48 (9%) were primarily academics.

Students came from 66 countries (75% from Africa with the largest number from Nigeria) and their distribution is shown in the Figure

159 passed with a master’s award – 94 with the MPH from Manchester Metropolitan University, 37 with the MPH from Euclid University and 28 with the Peoples-uni master’s award.

A further 45 students gained a Diploma (passing the requisite number of coursework modules, but not progressing to the Dissertation) and 96 students gained a Certificate (passing half the number of modules required for the Diploma).
