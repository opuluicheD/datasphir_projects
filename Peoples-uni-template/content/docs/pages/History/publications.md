## Closing Chapter

Closing a chapter on a successful online pubic health capacity building experiment – the Peoples-uni Peoples-uni was established as an educational charity designed to build Public Health capacity in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) through online learning. Using open source software, Open Educational Resources and volunteer tutors, the programme produced a number of successful outcomes. Peoples-uni closed in 2021, its programme taken over by another organisation, and this paper builds on previous reports to summarise the experience and draw lessons for others who may wish to contribute in a similar way.
