# The Peoples-Uni Mision and Objectives

## The Mision

Peoples-uni started in 2006 with the mission “To contribute to improvements in the health of populations in low- to middle-income countries by building Public Health capacity via e-learning at very low cost”

## The Objectives

1. Provide Public Health education for those working in low- to middle-income countries who would otherwise not be able to access such education, via Internet-based e-learning

2. Utilise a 'social model' of capacity building, with volunteer academic and support staff and Open Educational Resources available through the Internet, using a collaborative approach and modern Information and Communication Technology

3. Offer education at the 'train the trainers' benchmarked to the master's degree level, for those with prior educational and occupational experience

4. Provide education that meets identified competencies that help with the evidence-based practice of Public Health and are action-oriented, to assist in tackling major health problems facing the populations in which the students work

5. Create an educational portfolio including Continuing Professional Development modules and awards of Certificate, Diploma and Master of Public Health

6. Work with the graduates of the educational programme, and other relevant partner organisations, in teaching, research, implementation of evidence-based health policy and advocacy to improve the health of their populations.

## Comment

We are proud to note that each of the first 5 Objectives has been achieved. With the closure of Peoples-uni and the transfer of the educational programme to NextGEnU.org, the focus of those who established the programme will shift to Objective 6 - how can we build on the skills gained to improve the health of populations. A master’s degree is only the first step along this path. For further information please contact Professor Heller.
