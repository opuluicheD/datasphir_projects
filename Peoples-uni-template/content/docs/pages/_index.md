## Major Achievement

-  Volunteer expert tutors from 50 countries

-  Students from 100 countries (70% from Africa)

-  159 Public Health master’s graduates from Peoples-uni, or its partners Manchester Metropolitan University and Euclid University
-  Many more students took individual modules or courses for their continuing professional development including 4500 enrolments on the Peoples-uni Open Online Courses site

-  An active Alumni group with a number of peer reviewed collaborative publications and a number of Alumni joining as tutors

## The future

We plan to build on these achievements and our original objectives, in particular working with master’s level graduates, to support global efforts to accelerate the development of much needed public health capacity
Our sincere thanks to all the volunteers and partners who supported us in various ways and helped show that there is an affordable way to deliver quality education and build public health capacity globally. We wish all of them and all the students and alumni the best in their future plans.
