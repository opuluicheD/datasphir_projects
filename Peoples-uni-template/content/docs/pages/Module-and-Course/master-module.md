# The Master Module Course Curriculum

Master's awards were provided by Manchester Metropolitan University and Euclid University as MPH degrees and by Peoples-uni as a master's level award. Each used the same curriculum, assessments and external review.

The Curriculum for the master's programmes included core and optional modules, as in the table below. Students were eligible to enrol in the master's programmes after passing two modules. Note: During the time that Manchester Metropolitan University was offering its MPH degree to Peoples-uni graduates, the requirements were for only 6 modules to be completed other than the Dissertation, and these modules carried 20 credits each
