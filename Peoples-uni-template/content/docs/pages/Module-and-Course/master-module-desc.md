Communicable diseases result from spread of a causative organism from people to people or from animals to people. They produce a major burden of illness globally, but particularly in low-income settings. There are also a number of real or potential emerging communicable diseases, as evidenced by the emergence of swine flu, and an understanding of the causes, transmission and methods of prevention and control of communicable diseases is major global Public Health priority. Hence this module, which covers the Public Health aspects of communicable diseases including transmission and surveillance of diseases of public health importance, the application and design of control programmes, the epidemiology of common communicable diseases, immunisation, and how to respond to an outbreak.

This module comprises 5 Topics, which cover:

-  Immunisation
-  Responding to a communicable disease outbreak.
-  Application and design of control programmes for communicable diseases

### Disaster Management & Emergency Planning [PUDMEP] 15 credits

All communities are vulnerable to disaster and following the event would endeavour to limit the damage from it. Assessing and reducing the risks before a disaster occurs is as important as responding to it and dealing with the consequences; both need to be professional to be effective.

This module comprises 5 Topics, which cover:

There is much more that needs to be done to improve the lives and outcomes of those people who develop mental illness. The module aims to help you understand some of the risk factors, and size of the burden of mental illness and think about policies and interventions that can help tackle this neglected public health issue. By the end students will be armed to appraise the evidence base required to plan interventions to reduce the impact of mental illness

This module comprises 5 Topics, which cover:

## REQUIREMENT FOR MASTERS (AFTER PASSING 8 OF THE MODULES ABOVE FOR A DIPLOMA)

### Dissertation [Diss] 60 credits

The Dissertation aims to enable students to synthesise the previous parts of their learning experience, and to build on their experience in the course as well as utilising skills and knowledge to develop, critically assess and evaluate a potential solution to a locally relevant Public Health problem.
