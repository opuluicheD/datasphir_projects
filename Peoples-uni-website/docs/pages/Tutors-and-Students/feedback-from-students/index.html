						A message about the closure of Peoples-uni to graduates
						produced a number of responses indicating the impact on their
						careers. Here is a sample:
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am writing to express profound gratitude and deep respect.
						You may never know the REAL WORLD impact your altruism has
						made. Nonetheless, I am personally very grateful for People's
						Uni. It is because of your work that I have a career today.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“Peoples Uni help me as the foundation for my academic
						career!!!”
					</p>
					<p>
						“Even after post graduation from a reputed college of India, I
						had enrolled in MPH and I could learn so much more!! Many
						others like me has benefited from Peoples Uni too.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“..high-quality low-cost education to the disadvantaged
						population, which has been hitherto a reserve to the rich. I
						am a beneficiary of this goodwill and without which I wouldn't
						have the competitive edge to Harvard University as a visiting
						postdoctoral fellow.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“As a beneficiary from People's Uni, my career development
						advanced thanks to this institution.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am however grateful for the opportunity that you and your
						team provided to us on this unique platform. To learn and
						empower us with world class education in public health at a
						very affordable rate which is exclusive reserve for the rich.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“Peoples-uni has made a huge difference in my life and work. I
						had identified some gaps in my training and knowledge,
						Peoples-uni allowed me to fill these gaps and made me better.
						Peoples-uni was a wonderful initiative and as others have said
						provided a unique opportunity for those from disadvantaged
						backgrounds.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am grateful for the role the pu had in shaping my career.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“My life and professional carrier have been impacted
						positively by you and your colleague. The exposure to your
						courses has brought me out of my clinician mindset and led me
						to a combined experience in public health and clinical
						service. The skill has helped me in my work in the ministry of
						health top management and as a clinical researcher in the
						academic world.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“The life that i am enjoying now its because of Peoples-Uni
						and the Team”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I take this opportunity to thank you very much and your team
						for making it possible for us to get a word class education in
						public health. Peoples Uni maybe closing but it's impact will
						last for generations to come.”
