						Feedback from tutors

					</h1>
					<p>
						Many responses were received from tutors to a message
						announcing the closure of Peoples-uni. Among these were a
						number indicating the impact on the tutors’ own personal
						development, for example:
					</p>
					<p>
						“Even though my association with Peoples-uni was brief, it
						played a significant role in getting me to where I am today.
						It was Peoples-uni that gave me my first exposure to teaching
						and curriculum matters. Student learning was the ultimate
						goal, and I am still to find a program that provided so much
						support to help them reach their potential. I am sure there
						are so many tutors around the world who would have learnt so
						much about curriculum delivery and online teaching methods,
						through their participation in this program”
					</p>
					<p>
						“Peoples uni also helped facilitate its voluntary tutors into
						on line educators, a skill so in need in today's world. It's a
						skill that remains embedded in my CV. In fact it helped me as
						a teacher myself doing all that home schooling in the UK last
						year, as the format chosen by my school was quite similar to
						peoples uni!”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am very thankful for the opportunity you gave me and I'm
						glad I was part of People's Uni family. You trusted me with a
						leadership position despite the fact that I'm at an early
						stage of my career, and this means a lot to me. I can't thank
						you enough for this.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“This email also brought back for me so many happy memories of
						my own learning as a People’s-uni tutor, all thanks to you. It
						was my first real experience of leading a module and was such
						a good experience for teaching in my current job.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“it has been a pleasure to be part of a value driven
						initiative. I feel very grateful to have been part of the team
						and to facilitate continued learning for so many students who
						may not have had opportunities to engage in master level
						education in a different format.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I wanted to express my gratitude to you for giving us the
						teachers and the students the opportunity of being involved in
						such a valuable initiative. Witnessing its development from
						its conception has been a wonderful experience for me. It has
						been an encouraging experience for those who have ideals.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am feeling to have hiccups after reading the email. I do
						not know what to say because I enjoyed/learnt a lot from this
						'PU family'.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“PU taught me some of the most precious lessons and inspired
						me to a few of my important steps. It was a world-changing
						initiative, literally.”
