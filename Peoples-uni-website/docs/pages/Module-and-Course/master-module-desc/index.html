					<p>
						Communicable diseases result from spread of a causative
						organism from people to people or from animals to people. They
						produce a major burden of illness globally, but particularly
						in low-income settings. There are also a number of real or
						potential emerging communicable diseases, as evidenced by the
						emergence of swine flu, and an understanding of the causes,
						transmission and methods of prevention and control of
						communicable diseases is major global Public Health priority.
						Hence this module, which covers the Public Health aspects of
						communicable diseases including transmission and surveillance
						of diseases of public health importance, the application and
						design of control programmes, the epidemiology of common
						communicable diseases, immunisation, and how to respond to an
						outbreak.

						All communities are vulnerable to disaster and following the

						Mental health issues universally concentrate amongst the poor

						The module aims to help you understand some of the risk
						factors, and size of the burden of mental illness and think

						armed to appraise the evidence base required to plan
						interventions to reduce the impact of mental illness

						Maternal morbidity and mortality remain major problems in many
						parts of the world - one of the most important threats to
						Public Health. The purpose of the unit is to provide the
						people who may be able to help tackle the problem with the
						knowledge and skills to do so. The unit focuses on identifying
						the size of the problem, the causes, and the evidence base
						behind interventions to improve the situation, and ends by
						identifying ways to implement evidence based solutions in your
						own setting.
					</p>
					<p>This module comprises 5 Topic which cover:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Magnitude of the problem of Maternal Mortality</li>
						<li>Causes and epidemiology</li>
						<li>Evidence based solutions within the health system</li>
						<li>Evidence based solutions outside the health system</li>
						<li>Implementing an Intervention.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Despite a focus on the control of communicable diseases in
						developing countries in the past, it is now apparent that
						non-communicable diseases have crept up on these populations
						and create a major threat. The module aims to help
						practitioners understand the size of this threat and its
						causes, and to develop policies to reduce the growing burden
						on developing country populations. We cannot cover all
						non-communicable diseases in this module, and have chosen to
						focus on CVD and Diabetes. Learning from this module will help
						students appreciate the evidence base required to plan
						interventions to reduce the threat from these conditions.
					</p>
					<p>This module comprises:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Size of the problem (burden of illness, macroeconomics)
						</li>
						<li>
							Causes (risk factors, including individual, population and
							socio-cultural determinants)
						</li>
						<li>
							Appraising the evidence that underpins international
							interventions and prevention programmes
						</li>
						<li>
							How can we make health policies to reduce the burden of NCD
						</li>
						<li>Implementing prevention programmes</li>

						This module aims to help build capacity to understand and
						prevent threats to patient safety globally. It includes an
						understanding of the main threats to patient safety, and how
						to use an evidence based approach to the investigation and
						reduction of these threats.
					</p>
					<p>This module comprises 5 Topic which cover:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The concept and context of patient safety</li>
						<li>
							Human and systems factors as a threat to patient safety
						</li>
						<li>Investigating patient safety incidents</li>

						This module focuses on understanding the burden of childhood
						disease that results in morbidity and mortality in this
						vulnerable population. Children are an invaluable population
						resource and childhood mortality has great importance in terms
						of a nation’s development, prosperity and well-being. This
						module has a multi-disciplinary focus that will help students
						appreciate this complex concept.

						This module aims to provide information to enable students to
						understand key nutrition issues and then integrate this
						knowledge into devising evidence-based nutrition interventions
						and evidence-based policies that meet the health and nutrition
						needs of vulnerable communities in developing country
						settings.
					</p>
					<p>This module comprises 5 Topic which cover:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fundamentals of nutrition, Public Health nutrition and
							assessment of nutritional status
						</li>
						<li>Issues in nutrition of importance to Public Health</li>
						<li>Food supply, policy and security</li>

						The Dissertation aims to enable students to synthesise the
						previous parts of their learning experience, and to build on
						their experience in the course as well as utilising skills and
						knowledge to develop, critically assess and evaluate a
						potential solution to a locally relevant Public Health
						problem. Each student will be assigned an academic supervisor
						and a local advisor, and will be enrolled in a facilitated
						discussion forum with other students enrolled in the
						dissertation. Each student will be expected to produce a
						systematic literature review, a research project design, and a
						reflective essay.
