						Our journey
						<a class="anchor" href="#our-journey"></a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						We started Peoples-uni with the mission to provide meaningful,
						good quality, affordable, online public health education to
						students in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and built
						up the organisation organically and opportunistically over the
						years by collaborating with others wherever possible. There
						was no traditional business plan and it was an evolving
						strategy – with this mission uppermost in our minds we
						reviewed and refined our plans periodically, matching needs
						with available resources. This ‘experiment’ worked simply
						because of the power of volunteering – large numbers of people
						from various backgrounds joined in, to provide all the
						services like any higher education organisation including
						administrative, student support and technology services and
						the academics. Peoples-uni therefore is proof of the value of
						volunteering to make a difference by helping to build much
						needed public health capacity globally.
					</p>
					<p>
						On this journey we learnt many lessons, some of these are as
						follows and there are many publications of our experiences
						which provide further details, and which may be useful for
						others.<br />
						Our fundamental guiding principle was to ensure affordable,
						yet high quality, online education and indeed we had the idea
						that the education should be free to students who could not
						afford even a small fee – potentially feasible through the use
						of Open Source educational and IT materials with the help of
						expert volunteers.
					</p>
					<h2 id="sustaining-the-model">
						Sustaining the model
						<a class="anchor" href="#sustaining-the-model"></a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						We wanted to create a sustainable model for securing
						resources, since despite tremendous support the harsh reality
						is that some money is needed, for operations for paid staff or
						equipment and services.
					</p>
					<p>
						We realised that a sustainable future was not possible if we
						depended on periodic grant support, although we did secure a
						few. To supplement small fees from the students who could
						afford them, we adopted a differential model with more charges
						to students in developed countries than in LMICs, and to gain
						an accredited MPH from Manchester Metropolitan and Euclid
						Universities, even though the course was identical for all
						students.
					</p>
					<p>
						We approached many professional bodies for an association with
						them to enable our students to utilise their education with us
						for employment purposes - the link between education and
						employment and hence economic viability was an ever-present
						thought. Although in the early years we managed to secure an
						agreement with the UK Royal Society of Public Health, our
						efforts on the whole were not very successful in creating such
						associations. As we were not registered as an educational
						provider, we were not able to gain accreditation for our
						courses ourselves, and sought partnerships with universities
						for this purpose. Our many attempts at such partnerships with
						universities in different countries were generally
						unsuccessful. Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK was
						our initial partner for four semesters and was extremely
						valuable as we worked with them to ensure validation of the
						programme at the master’s level, although the partnership
						ceased as there was no perceived value for the partner
						university. Euclid University became our later partner and
						offered an accredited MPH to our graduates.
					</p>
					<p>
						Among the reasons given for failures to gain appropriate
						partnerships were Peoples-uni being seen as competition by the
						formal and established providers, not enough money being
						generated though our model, and over-reliance on volunteers.
						The first two are genuine real world issues since education is
						now a business and not a vocation, and educational providers
						have their own pressures and certainly in the UK the
						regulatory demands are onerous. We did try to find compromises
						but the latter was unbridgeable, volunteers were central to
						our model and in fact, we had created an international cadre
						of expert committed volunteers. We were very reluctant to
						scale up to increase student numbers, as often required with
						traditional business models with low cost ‘products’, since
						that would have put more pressure on volunteers and
						compromised the quality of teaching that we could offer; this
						was specially true for the dissertations which, despite our
						approach to add structure and streamline processes, required a
						lot of personal and academic support for students.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our volunteers ranged from newly qualified graduates to fully
						established and retired professionals, and the main reason for
						the success of the model was the ability to create specific
						roles and tasks which fit in with what the volunteers wanted
						to offer and they could choose to stay for as long or as short
						as they could. This strength of the model was also its
						weakness since although volunteers can and often did major
						elements of work, managing the whole enterprise and discrete
						components of work do require dedicated administration and
						management. We experimented with paid roles – apart from for
						the administrative services – but our aspiration to keep costs
						down to ensure affordable education and hence very low fees
						and our intention of containing student numbers to avoid
						overloading the tutors – meant that we could not create
						equivalent paid positions for the needed roles.
					</p>
					<h2 id="lessons-learned">
						Lessons learned
						<a class="anchor" href="#lessons-learned"></a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						So there was a vicious cycle – with the need for money versus
						affordable education dilemma – and we were really targetting
						the most needy in very poor circumstances – and we could not
						turn it into a virtuous cycle by creating alternative sources
						of funding such as through charities or government grants.
						Could we have done something different was a recurring thought
						and we sought advice - generously given by some senior figures
						– but the ‘ideal’ vs ‘practical’ gap remained unbridgeable,
						certainly for us. There is clearly a lesson for others, and we
						hope, and believe, that there are people who are better able
						to overcome some of the challenges we faced, and we wish them
						luck. Since our educational courses have been created under
						Creative Common Licences, and the software infrastructure
						published on an open source facility, we hope that others can
						use and built on our developments. In any case, after 15 years
						and having achieved our major objectives, in the light of
						other developments with other providers coming up, and our
						personal positions and need to focus on other things where we
						are now better placed to add - value, we had to close the
						operations. NextGenU.org has already taken the infrastructure
						over to continue what we started, under their banner and we
						wish them luck.
					</p>
					<p>
						The need for public health capacity, already there, has become
						more apparent with the Covid 19 pandemic and so is the need
						for online education. Covid 19, like many other public health
						problems, shows that ultimately what is needed is
						strengthening of health systems overall and on an ongoing
						continuous basis. This can not happen with the current and
						established university system – new models of quality,
						affordable and accredited education are needed. Whilst many of
						the obstacles are being overcome in various ways through
						Creative Commons licencing, Open Source etc, the biggest block
						that still remains is accreditation. Clearly something needs
						to change in the system globally, otherwise the workforce
						shortages estimated by the WHO can not be met and inequalities
						will rise as expensive education will push workers to better
						paid jobs, not least to cover their costs. The starting point
						for strengthening health systems is and will be workforce. We
						hope that things will change and soon, and that others will
						take note of the Peoples-uni model; if it makes even a slight
						difference we would feel honoured to have played a small role.
						The main credit is due to our supporters and volunteers (past
						and present) – we could not have sustained Peoples-uni for so
						long without you.
