Builds on opportunities presented by the advent of OER** and availability of an open online platform (Moodle).   2007 Situation analysis performed in six developing countries. Few opportunities for master\u0026rsquo;s-level education in LMICs and large need identified.Focus on master\u0026rsquo;s level to develop future trainers to accelerate local workforce development.   2007 People\u0026rsquo;s Open Access Education Initiative (Peoples-uni) registered as UK charity. Educational purpose stated, but no registration as formal educational provider.   2007 Small team worked with Royal Society for Public Health to develop curriculum and course structure. Course based on previous experience of online learning and sound educational principles.   2008 Pilot Maternal Mortality module established on Moodle and run with 30 students in Africa and two tutors. Positive experience and feedback.   2008 Volunteer tutors to develop course modules and IT support identified through networks.     First six modules offered. All modules ran to timetable, fully supported by tutors and IT support, student feedback was positive.   2009 - 2011 Additional modules offered. Certificates and diplomas awarded.   Phase Two     2011 Partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) commenced after modification of modules and addition of Dissertation - Master of Public Health (MPH) degree approved. Large amount of administrative work to ensure compliance with requirements of a formal UK master\u0026rsquo;s level award.

There was no traditional business plan and it was an evolving strategy – with this mission uppermost in our minds we reviewed and refined our plans periodically, matching needs with available resources. This ‘experiment’ worked simply because of the power of volunteering – large numbers of people from various backgrounds joined in, to provide all the services like any higher education organisation including administrative, student support and technology services and the academics. Peoples-uni therefore is proof of the value of volunteering to make a difference by helping to build much needed public health capacity globally.\nOn this journey we learnt many lessons, some of these are as follows and there are many publications of our experiences which provide further details, and which may be useful for others.\nOur fundamental guiding principle was to ensure affordable, yet high quality, online education and indeed we had the idea that the education should be free to students who could not afford even a small fee – potentially feasible through the use of Open Source educational and IT materials with the help of expert volunteers.\nWe wanted to create a sustainable model for securing resources, since despite tremendous support the harsh reality is that some money is needed, for operations for paid staff or equipment and services.\nSustaining the model #  We realised that a sustainable future was not possible if we depended on periodic grant support, although we did secure a few grants. To supplement small fees from the students who could afford this, we adopted a differential model with more charges to students in developed countries than in LMICs, and to gain an accredited MPH from Manchester Metropolitan and Euclid Universities, even though the course was identical for all students.\nWe approached many professional bodies for an association with them, and although in the early years we managed to secure an agreement with the UK Royal Society of Public Health, our efforts on the whole we were not very successful in creating such associations. As we were not registered ourselves as an educational provider, we were not able to gain accreditation for our courses ourselves, and sought partnerships with universities for this purpose. Despite many attempts at such partnerships with universities in different countries, they were generally unsuccessful. Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK was our initial partner for four semesters and was extremely valuable as we worked with them to ensure validation of the programme at the master’s level, the partnership ceased as there was no perceived value for the partner university.\nAmong the reasons given for failures to gain appropriate partnerships were Peoples-uni being seen as competition by the formal and established providers, not enough money being generated though our model, and over-reliance on volunteers. The first two are genuine real world issues since education is now a business and not a vocation, and educational providers have their own pressures and certainly in the UK the regulatory demands are onerous. We did try to find compromises but the latter was unbridgeable, volunteers were central to our model and in fact, we had created an international cadre of expert committed volunteers. We were very reluctant to scale up to increase student numbers, as often required with traditional business models with low cost ‘products’, since that would have put more pressure on volunteers and compromise the quality of teaching that we could offer; this was specially true for the dissertations which, despite our approach to add structure to the process, required a lot of personal and academic support for students.\nOur volunteers ranged from newly qualified graduates to fully established and retired professionals, and the main reason for the success of the model was the ability to create specific roles and tasks which fit in with what the volunteers wanted to offer and they could choose to stay for as long or as short as they could. This strength of the model was also its weakness since although volunteers can and often did major elements of work, managing the whole enterprise and discrete components of work do require dedicated administration and management. We experimented with paid roles – apart from for the administrative services – but our aspiration to keep costs down to ensure affordable education and hence very low fees and our intention of containing student numbers to avoid overloading the tutors – meant that we could not create equivalent paid positions for the needed roles.\nLessons Learned #  So there was a vicious cycle – with the need for money versus affordable education dilemma – and we were really targetting the most needy in very poor circumstances – and we could not turn it into a virtuous cycle by creating alternative sources of funding such as through charities or government grants. Could we have done something different was a recurring thought and we sought advice - generously given by some senior figures – but the ‘ideal’ vs ‘practical’ gap remained unbridgeable, certainly for us. There is clearly a lesson for others, and we hope, and believe, that there are people who are better able to overcome some of the challenges we faced, and we wish them luck. Since our educational courses have been created under Creative Common Licences, and the software infrastructure published on an open source facility, we hope that others can use and built on our developments. In any case, after 15 years and having achieved our major objectives, in the light of other developments with other providers coming up, and our personal positions and need to focus on other things where we are now better placed to add - value, we had to close the operations. NextGenU.org has already taken the infrastructure over to continue what we started, under their banner and we wish them luck.\nThe need for public health capacity, already there, has become more apparent with the Covid 19 pandemic and so is the need for online education. Covid 19, like many other public health problems shows that ultimately what is needed is strengthening of health systems overall and on an ongoing continuous basis. This can not happen with the current and established university system – new models of quality, affordable and accredited education are needed. Whilst many of the obstacles are being overcome in various ways through Creative Commons licencing, Open Source etc, the biggest block that still remains is accreditation. Clearly something needs to change in the system globally, otherwise the workforce shortages estimated by the WHO can not be met and inequalities will rise as expensive education will push workers to better paid jobs, not least to cover their costs. The starting point for strengthening health systems is and will be workforce. We hope that things will change and soon, and that others will take note of the Peoples-uni model; if it makes even a slight difference we would feel honoured to have played a small role. The main credit is due to our supporters and volunteers (past and present) – we could not have sustained Peoples-uni for so long without you.\nThank you and good luck.\nRajan Madhok and Dick Heller\nMay 2021\n"}),a.add({id:7,href:'/docs/pages/Tutors-and-Students/list-of-tutors/',title:"Lists of Volunteers and Characteristics of Tutors",section:"Tutors and Students",content:"The List of Volunteers #  characteristics of Tutors #  "}),a.add({id:8,href:'/docs/pages/Module-and-Course/master-module/',title:"Master Module curriculum",section:"Module and Course",content:"The Master Module Course Curriculum #  Master\u0026rsquo;s awards were provided by Manchester Metropolitan University and Euclid University as MPH degrees and by Peoples-uni as a master\u0026rsquo;s level award.

PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS GROUP #  Communicable Disease [transmission, surveillance and control] [PUCOMDIS] 15 credits #  Communicable diseases result from spread of a causative organism from people to people or from animals to people. They produce a major burden of illness globally, but particularly in low-income settings. There are also a number of real or potential emerging communicable diseases, as evidenced by the emergence of swine flu, and an understanding of the causes, transmission and methods of prevention and control of communicable diseases is major global Public Health priority. Hence this module, which covers the Public Health aspects of communicable diseases including transmission and surveillance of diseases of public health importance, the application and design of control programmes, the epidemiology of common communicable diseases, immunisation, and how to respond to an outbreak.\nThis module comprises 5 Topics, which cover:\n Key concepts of communicable disease Surveillance of disease of public health importance Immunisation Responding to a communicable disease outbreak. Application and design of control programmes for communicable diseases  Disaster Management \u0026amp; Emergency Planning [PUDMEP] 15 credits #  All communities are vulnerable to disaster and following the event would endeavour to limit the damage from it.

There is much more that needs to be done to improve the lives and outcomes of those people who develop mental illness. The module aims to help you understand some of the risk factors, and size of the burden of mental illness and think about policies and interventions that can help tackle this neglected public health issue. By the end students will be armed to appraise the evidence base required to plan interventions to reduce the impact of mental illness\nThis module comprises 5 Topics, which cover:\n Introduction to global mental health Health promotion and epidemiology Suicide - epidemiology and prevention Evidence based interventions Planning and implementing mental health interventions  HIV/AIDS [PUHIVAIDS] 15 credits #  This module is designed to provide an introduction to some of the Public Health aspects of HIV/AIDS and its impact on populations. Topics include the epidemiology of transmission, the size of the problem and how to measure it, the impact of health service functions and organisation on finding solutions, how to identify evidence-based solutions, and how to implement interventions\nThis module comprises 5 Topic which cover:\n Epidemiology of HIV Size of the problem HIV and the Pharmaceutical Industry HIV, policy and politics HIV, interventions, and other diseases.  Injury Prevention [PUINJURY] 15 credits #  This module is designed to help students learn how to collect information on the burden of injury in their setting, understand the causes and risk factors for injury, and develop and evaluate intervention programs relevant to their setting. This will be underpinned by the principles and characteristics of a public health approach to prevention.\nThis module comprises 5 Topic which cover:\n Burden of disease from injury Principles and conceptual frameworks Risk factors and causes of injury Development of interventions Implementation of prevention strategies.  Maternal Mortality [PUMM] 15 credits #  Maternal morbidity and mortality remain major problems in many parts of the world - one of the most important threats to Public Health. The purpose of the unit is to provide the people who may be able to help tackle the problem with the knowledge and skills to do so. The unit focuses on identifying the size of the problem, the causes, and the evidence base behind interventions to improve the situation, and ends by identifying ways to implement evidence based solutions in your own setting.\nThis module comprises 5 Topic which cover:\n Magnitude of the problem of Maternal Mortality Causes and epidemiology Evidence based solutions within the health system Evidence based solutions outside the health system Implementing an Intervention.  Non-Communicable Disease - CVD \u0026amp; Diabetes [PUNCD] 15 credits #  Despite a focus on the control of communicable diseases in developing countries in the past, it is now apparent that non-communicable diseases have crept up on these populations and create a major threat. The module aims to help practitioners understand the size of this threat and its causes, and to develop policies to reduce the growing burden on developing country populations. We cannot cover all non-communicable diseases in this module, and have chosen to focus on CVD and Diabetes. Learning from this module will help students appreciate the evidence base required to plan interventions to reduce the threat from these conditions.\nThis module comprises:\n Size of the problem (burden of illness, macroeconomics) Causes (risk factors, including individual, population and socio-cultural determinants) Appraising the evidence that underpins international interventions and prevention programmes How can we make health policies to reduce the burden of NCD Implementing prevention programmes  Patient Safety [PSAF] 15 credits #  This module aims to help build capacity to understand and prevent threats to patient safety globally.
